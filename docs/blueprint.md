## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Vibrant purple (#A020F0) to signify community and unity.
- Background color: Light gray (#F0F0F0) for a clean and accessible interface.
- Accent color: Electric blue (#7DF9FF) for highlighting important CTAs and interactive elements, as it is slightly to the 'left' of the purple hue on the color wheel.
- Font pairing: 'Space Grotesk' sans-serif for headers paired with 'Inter' sans-serif for body text, gives a balance of tech and neutral looks.
- Use flat, minimalist icons that visually represent community activities. This includes unique iconography for expressing love and VIP recognition.
- Employ a grid-based layout for clear and structured content presentation.
- Use subtle animations to acknowledge user interactions and transitions.
